                        I'm a Web Developer based in Lagos, Nigerian. I focus on creating userâ€‘friendly websites with preference to the React.js framework. I am proficient in HTML and CSS also, and I have built some other simple projects with JavaScript and SASS. I'm passionate and motivated in taking on any challenges.
                        when building or cloning web projects, I strongly adhere to Responsive Design, Great UI/UX & Accessibility  and Reusable & minimal code principles which makes my websites both unique and scaleable.
                        In my spare time, I love to watch movies and listen to R&B music.
